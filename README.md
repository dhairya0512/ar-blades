## Description

The multiplayer augmented reality application developed in Unity with Photon Pun 2 and Google's AR Core library allows two people to play together in the same game room, regardless of their physical location. The game is played on mobile devices, and each player sees the same virtual objects overlaid onto the real world through their camera feed.

The game involves a series of challenges that require players to work together to complete. For example, they might need to find hidden objects in the real world or solve puzzles using clues hidden in the virtual world. Players can communicate with each other through voice chat or text messages within the app.

The app also includes a matchmaking system that pairs players with others who are of a similar skill level or have similar interests. As players progress through the game, they earn points and can unlock new levels and challenges. Overall, the app provides a fun and engaging way for people to connect and play together in a shared virtual space.
